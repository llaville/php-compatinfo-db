## 6.17.0 - 2025-05-04

May the 4th be with you ;-)

### Changed

- `psr/log` dependency moved from Composer `require-dev` to `require`. Reason is given by `composer why psr/log` command

## Fixed

- [#143](https://github.com/llaville/php-compatinfo-db/issues/143) : `symfony/framework-bundle` is necessary only for `debug:event-dispatcher` and `debug:container` commands
